# Alaska Fishing Adventure

My favorite thing to do growing up was fishing. When I was 14 years old, I got the chance to go to Alaska for the first time with my 2 friends, Harry and Jake. The plan was to fly into Anchorage and get picked up by Jake's grandparents, who retired in Alaska and lived on the Kenai Peninsula in Soldotna.

When we got there, we met Jake's grandpa and got in the car for the 3-hour drive back to his house. Excitement filled the air as we learned that the salmon run had been fantastic so far. We reached Jake's grandparents' house and almost immediately went to bed, even though it was past midnight with the sun still out.

The next morning, we got up, packed all our gear, and headed out to Skilak Lake. We were embarking on a short 2-day float/fish/camp trip to experience Alaska's wilderness while fishing one of the best salmon rivers in the world. Although we had never done this type of trip before, Jakes' grandpa was with us to ensure we stayed out of trouble.

We caught and released around 50 salmon on the first day. It was incredible. We stopped to camp and cooked up one of the salmon we caught that night. As we prepared for bed, two brown bears stumbled upon us. While we were freaking out, eye to eye with two six-hundred-pound brown bears, Jakes' grandpa remained calm, as if he had been through this same thing hundreds of times. He drew his rifle in case the bears decided to charge.

The bears kept creeping closer, eventually separating from one another in an attempt to corner us. Jakes' grandpa fired his rifle to scare them off, and it worked. However, when one of the bears started running, it chose a direction that put my friend Harry right in its path. The bear essentially tackled Harry and kept running. We ran to his side to ensure he was okay, and thankfully, he was just scratched up a little.

We all sat down on a log, still very much on edge, and finally, the silence broke. Jakes' grandpa let out a laugh, saying that this would be a trip we'd never forget. He was not wrong. Every part of that trip, I can still remember like it was yesterday.
