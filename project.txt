Welcome to the 2023 Washington State Motorcycle Hall of Fame website. 
We are celebrating our 11th year of honoring legends/heroes here in the Northwest 
that have paved their way and stamped their names into the history books.

This year we will be honoring 4 different individuals that have created an impact in the motorcycle industry while striving to their life long achievements.


First up we have Carl, with his innovative new motorcycle design that brews coffee while you ride.
Now you can get your caffeine fix on the go!!!
