Welcome to the 2023 Washington State Motorcycle Hall of Fame website. 
We are celebrating our 11th year of honoring legends/heroes here in the Northwest 
that have paved their way and stamped their names into the history books.

This year we will be honoring 4 different individuals that have created an impact in the motorcycle industry while striving to their life long achievements.



I'm thrilled to share that I just created my first Git branch! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŽ‰ This marks a significant step in our project development, allowing us to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
